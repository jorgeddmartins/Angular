# Explanation

This is a simple UX/UI solution for the user to choose a sandwish as quick as possible with an user authentication. \
This solution is responsive for all devices ( Desktop, Smartphones, Ipad, Tables, Iphone, Android, etc ).

When user opens the app, the user will see all Sandwishes displayed with all information ( Sandwish Image, Description, Price and a botton to buy the sandwish )
When the user choose a sandwish and click on its botton to buy it, an authentication pop up shows up, in that pop up the user has to options of authentication:
1- With an Email an Password \
2- With a Google account

After the authentication done, the app would drive the user to the checkout page. \
The goal is that the user could buy a sandwish in just 2 / 3 minutes maximum and to be as much user freindly possible. \
After the user be logged In, the user can navigate to the "My Orders" and can reorder again the same order in just one click.

# Conclusion

I had the idea to build this solution, because I was imagning working in BHA and what would be like in a lunch time when I'll be with dead lines?
So, with a simple solution like this one it would be great to not loose much time to get my or my team mates lunch. :)

In this solution first the user sees all products displayed from an API and then if the user decides to get one product, just need to do a quick authentication
and buy the product straight away.

This is a good solution, thank you for the opportunity!
